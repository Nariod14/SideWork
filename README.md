# Sidework

**Sidework** is a location-aware Android application developed to connect individuals offering and seeking short-term, flexible work often referred to as "odd jobs" ithin their local communities. The project was built as part of a software development placement at Dalhousie University from September to December 2023, with a focus on backend optimization and intelligent job recommendations.

The app targets students, freelancers, and community members who want to earn extra income or outsource simple tasks like moving help, yard work, tutoring, and delivery.

## Project Highlights

### Geolocation-Based Matching
Implemented geolocation-aware filtering and recommendation logic to surface relevant job listings based on the user’s current location. This significantly improved match quality and engagement by prioritizing proximity and availability.

### Backend Development
Contributed to the development and integration of core backend systems, using Java and Firebase. Focus areas included:

- Designing scalable data structures for storing job listings, user profiles, and preferences.
- Implementing real-time updates to ensure posted jobs appear instantly on nearby users’ feeds.
- Securing user authentication and access control using Firebase Authentication.

### Performance & Optimization
- Refactored backend interactions to reduce redundant network calls and improve app responsiveness.
- Developed modular code structures to support future expansion, such as user reviews, messaging, or payment processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Platform:** Android
- **IDE:** Android Studio
- **Backend Services:** Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication
- **APIs:** Android Location Services, Google Play Services

## Goals

- Provide a reliable, fast way for users to find or offer flexible work in their area.
- Build a scalable and maintainable backend architecture.
- Explore the practical application of geolocation in recommendation systems.

## Status

This project represents the foundation of a larger vision for a community-driven job-sharing platform. Developed and tested as a functional prototype, with potential for future enhancements such as in-app communication, job tracking, ratings, and secure payments.
